# Logic Programming laboratories at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca 
[First iteration]

In this repository you can find the documentation for every laboratory session in both English and Romanian. Moreover, you can find a template for each laboratory session upon which to implement your own code.

## Laboratory Guide

### About the laboratory
This semester, you will learn a new programming language, called Prolog. The solutions to the exercises will be written in a text editor (ex: Notepad++) and will be loaded and tested in a Prolog interpretor (ex: SWI Prolog, SWISH Prolog).

### Laboratory Format

#### Rules
- The Laboratory Materials must be read before the laboratory session
- la finalul fiecÄƒrui laborator, trebuie sa urci codul sursa pe moodle
- Attendance is mandatory
- One absence can be recovered (the corresponding assignment MUST be delivered and verified the following week) 
- A second and third absence can be recovered in the special laboratory session at the end of the semester (surcharge) by solving additional assignments (solving the corresponding assignment of the missed session will NOT be considered)
- If you miss more than 3 sessions, you will not be able to attend the exam in the regular exam session 
- ON OCCASION, you can attend another laboratory sessions in the same week with another group if you announce your laboratory assistant on email and you receive his agreement.

#### Grading
- The laboratory grade is equal to 30% of the final grade
- Activity during the laboratory sessions throughout the semester is taken into consideration for the final grade of the laboratory! The grade of the laboratory will be given following a written test and an oral evalution at the end of the semester, the Teaching Assistant will also take into account the activity throughout the semester when grading.

#### Laboratory session transfer
If you wish to participate at laboratory sessions with another Teaching Assistant, you must follow these rules:
- Student S1 from group G1 can transfer to group G2 if and only if a student S2 from group G2 can be found that is willing to participate with G1 at the assigned laboratory session hours of G1. 

To formalize the transfer you must send an email in which you mention with whom are you making the transfer/exchange:
- An email from S1 to both laboratory assistants
- An email from S2 to both laboratory assistants

The laboratory session transfer deadline is the end of the second week of the semester.
